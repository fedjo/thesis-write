    abstract="Recently Viola et al. have introduced a rapid object detection scheme
    based on a boosted cascade of simple feature classifiers. In this paper we
    introduce and empirically analysis two extensions to their approach:
    Firstly, a novel set of rotated haar-like features is introduced. These novel
    features significantly enrich the simple features of [6] and can also be
    calculated efficiently. With these new rotated features our sample face detector
    shows off on average a 10{\%} lower false alarm rate at a given hit rate.
    Secondly, we present a through analysis of different boosting algorithms (namely
    Discrete, Real and Gentle Adaboost) and weak classifiers on the detection
    performance and computational complexity. We will see that Gentle Adaboost with
    small CART trees as base classifiers outperform Discrete Adaboost and stumps.
    The complete object detection training and detection system as well as a trained
    face detector are available in the Open Computer Vision Library at sourceforge.net [8].",

    abstract="This paper describes a face detection framework that is capable of
    processing images extremely rapidly while achieving high detection rates. There
    are three key contributions. The first is the introduction of a new image
    representation called the Integral Image which allows the features used by our
    detector to be computed very quickly. The second is a simple and efficient classifier
    which is built using the AdaBoost learning algorithm (Freund and Schapire, 1995)
    to select a small number of critical visual features from a very large set of
    potential features. The third contribution is a method for combining classifiers
    in a cascade which allows background regions of the image to be quickly discarded
    while spending more computation on promising face-like regions. A set of
    experiments in the domain of face detection is presented. The system yields face
    detection performance comparable to the best previous systems
    (Sung and Poggio, 1998; Rowley et al., 1998; Schneiderman and Kanade, 2000; Roth et al., 2000).
    Implemented on a conventional desktop, face detection proceeds at 15 frames per second.",
