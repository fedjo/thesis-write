abstract="Recently Viola et al. have introduced a rapid object detection scheme
based on a boosted cascade of simple feature classifiers. In this paper we
introduce and empirically analysis two extensions to their approach:
Firstly, a novel set of rotated haar-like features is introduced. These novel
features significantly enrich the simple features of [6] and can also be
calculated efficiently. With these new rotated features our sample face detector
shows off on average a 10{\%} lower false alarm rate at a given hit rate.
Secondly, we present a through analysis of different boosting algorithms (namely
Discrete, Real and Gentle Adaboost) and weak classifiers on the detection
performance and computational complexity. We will see that Gentle Adaboost with
small CART trees as base classifiers outperform Discrete Adaboost and stumps.
The complete object detection training and detection system as well as a trained
face detector are available in the Open Computer Vision Library at sourceforge.net [8].",
